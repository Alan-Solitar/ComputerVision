1. I completed all parts of the assignment.

2. Not really a bug but I will say that I had some issues with the centroid approach.  In comparison
the local max approach worked very well.
3. My program can be run with the accompanying make file.

I have included the different runs in the makefile.
They are labeled by program name and by a letter a,b, or c.

a is for hough_simple_1
b is for hough_simple_2
c is for hough_complex_1

The runs are:

runh1a: 	
runh1b: 	
runh1c: 	
runh2a: 	
runh2b: 	
runh2c: 	
runh3a: 	
runh3b: 	
runh3c: 	
runh4a: 	
runh4b: 	
runh4c: 	
		

4. All files produced by any of the programs are labeled similar by program and by also use the same
letter explained in the previous part above
