prob 1.
I= I(x)
n = n(x) = εsin(ωx)
I = I(x) + n(x)
I = I(x) + εsin(ωx)

I' = I'(x) + (ω)εcos(ωx)

I' = I'(x) + ωεcos(ωx)

This shows that depending on the value of ω, the noise can cause a fairly significant change to the value
of the signal I

prob 2. 

Equation of Line:
xcosθ+ ysinθ = ρ
